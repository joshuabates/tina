- tmux panes usually don't have project name, usually they the use tina-monitor-phase-{n}, once I saw one that used cd /tesse{n}exect, sometimes they have project name. 
we should maybe have a binary that generates the name to force it to be consistent and always include feature and phase so everything is sturctured and consistent

- it opened claude once without --dangerously-skip-permissions

- It doesn't have a HARD rule about all tests passing and no warnings

- we leave extra teammates around rather than shutting them down when they complete
