# Legacy Designs Directory (Deprecated)

This directory contains the original design system prototype. It has been superseded by the vendored workbench runtime at `ui/designs/`.

**Active location:** `ui/designs/runtime/` (workbench runtime) and `ui/designs/sets/` (design content)

Do not add new designs here. Use `ui/designs/sets/<design>/<variation>/` instead.

See `skills/wireframing/SKILL.md` for the wireframing workflow.
